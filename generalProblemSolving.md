# General Problem Solving

## Steps
1. Understand the Problem
2. Devise a Plan
3. Carry Out the Plan
4. Review/Reflect on Solution

### Understanding the Problem
Identify what is being asked and clarify it by restating in your own words. 
Ensure all information is accounted for, and determine what is unknown
Ensure you understand the condition/restraints

### Devising a Plan
Think of problems you have solved in the past and how they can help. 

#### General Strategies
##### Guess and Check
Make an educated guess and check if it works. Modify it if needed

##### Work Backward
Take the desired result and think backwards

##### Divide and Conquer
Break the problem into smaller parts, or remove an aspect of the condition. Recombine the solved smaller problems

### Carrying Out the Plan
Stick to the plan for a while, but don't be afraid to adjust fire as needed.
Stay organized and keep track of what you did, and of what did and didn't work.

### Reviewing/Reflecting on the Solution
Verify you solved all aspects of the problem
Conduct an AAR to understand the problem more deeply, to generalize out a pattern for later use, or just to identify alternate solutions
